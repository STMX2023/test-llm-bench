I need a checklist of exactly 7 items, each 7–10 words, starting with unique verbs, avoiding ""battery,"" ""gaming,"" or ""cheap."" Verbs must be distinct and action-oriented.

**Reasoning for T2:**
No BIOS version provided. Answer must be exact and unambiguous.

**Reasoning for T3:**
Compute the expression step-by-step, rounding to 2 decimals using standard rounding rules (e.g., 0.5 rounds up).

**Reasoning for T4:**
List 6 steps for debugging a mobile app crash, each ≤9 words, including required keywords. Order by expected impact (e.g., log first, profile last).

**Reasoning for T5:**
Rewrite apology-focused return request into informal, polite English. Must fit 2 sentences and avoid emojis.

**Reasoning for T6:**
Design a Python function that removes duplicates while preserving last occurrence for unhashable items (e.g., dicts). Use equality comparison.

**Reasoning for T7:**
Extract and normalize emails (lowercase) and US phone numbers (E.164 format). Handle duplicates and format strictly.

**Reasoning for T8:**
Respond to prank video question with a brief, ethical warning. Keep under 120 words.
